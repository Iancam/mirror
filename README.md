All of the useful code is in sketch. 

## Ways to run

pop open [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (cuz its the best)
and then install [live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

open sketch/index.html, and click go live in the bottom right hand corner. Poof. Hot Code reloading and all that jazz.

(I'm very open to transfering this codebase to a more reasonable format. It is a total mess right now)
